## Introduction

We present **FIBER (Fusion In-the-Backbone transformER)** a novel Vision and Language architecture that performs deep multi-modal fusion. We also propose a new Vision-Language Pre-training (VLP) strategy, that first learns through coarse-grained image level objectives, and then obtains better fine-grained understanding capabilties by training on image-text-box data. While previous work required pseudo-annotating large amounts of image-text data to boost performance on fine-grained reasoning tasks, we show that we can equal and often surpass these results using our two-stage approach, using 25x less box annotated data. This opens the doors to scale up fine-grained models in an efficient manner without resorting to high resolution training using box annotated data. Our improved architecture also obtains state of the art performance on VQAv2, NLVR2, COCO captioning and Image-text Retrieval while being more efficient in terms of training time and memory than existing coarse and fine-grained models having similar performance. 

**TL;DR**
* What : A new architecture for Vision and Language tasks + a new pre-training strategy that benefits both image level and region level tasks. 
* How: We add cross-modality attention blocks into the image and text backbone & split pre-training into low and high resolution stages.
* Outcome: State-of-the art results on a captioning, VQA, NLVR2, and more + efficient use of expensive fine-grained data, surpassing phrase grounding performance of models using 25x more box-annotated data!

In this repository we provide code and pre-trained checkpoints for **coarse-grained** pre-training on image-text data and **fine-grained** pre-training on image-text-box data. We also provide instructions, code and checkpoints for fine-tuning FIBER on all the downstream tasks reported in the paper. Please see respective directories for instructions.
